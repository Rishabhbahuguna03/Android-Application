Jai Hind one and all, Rishabh Bahuguna here starting my journey of basic android development stuff. 
For this, I took help from a series of tutorials by Anuj Bhaiyya ( github.com/anuj-kumar-sharma )
Whimsical lets us share our ideas to workplaces so that there is a basic framework of how our work or portfolio will be.

After this, I downloaded Android Studio application & now I am creating this app.
